# Exploratory Data Analysis: Course Project 1

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, in particular the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”

The goal of the project is to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007, and to reconstruct 4 plots given as part of the instructions using the base plotting system.

## R scripts

The project contains four separate R scripts named plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R, that construct the corresponding plots. The scripts also contain code for downloading and reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. The resulting plots are stored in PNG files. When sourced the scripts download and unzip the data in the working directory, if the data file is not already present.

## Generated plots

The project output is four separate plots stored as PNG files: plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png. The PNG file are generated in the working directory.
